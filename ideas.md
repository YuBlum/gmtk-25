__The theme is: _loop___

What loop might suggest:
- Repeating the same thing over and over again
  - Rogue-like
  - Same room, different outcomes (?)
  - Reverse back in time
  - Need to break the loop
- A bended curve (like a circle or something)
  - I really have no idea


Maybe an infinite side-scroller or something like that, that you need to complete a set of specific things to break out from the loop.
A space-shooter would fit well if this.
Maybe not even a side-scroller, just something that needs to be repeated over and over again.
What code this be?
- You enter a room, it is the same as the room before it. In there you clear waves of enemies and proceeds to the next room.
- After a two rooms or something some new shit apear out of no where. What this could be? idk
- You then have to follow that strange thing or something

For now do the gameplay loop of entering a room, enemy waves, kill the enemies and thats it.

After that think of some random thing to put after a few rooms.

scrap most of the previous ideas.

__Recursive Room__ (name of the game probably)
Is going to be an escape room.
One room with a bunch of items, you can place some items into somewhere in the room, when you exit the room you end up in the same room, but things change depending on the items put in the input, some new items pop up and so on. The objective will be to find the correct order of items to exit the room.

Maybe add some simple story-line about a shut-in person overcomming their stuff, maybe the items cold relate to that it would be cool.
